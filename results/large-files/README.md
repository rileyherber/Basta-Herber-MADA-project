# large-files

This folder is for output files that are so large that they cannot be tracked with
GitHub. That's generally anything above around 20MB. 

Such large files might result from creating posterior samples from Bayesian models.

Don't use this folder for large raw data files. If you need to store large raw data files, create a separate folder for that, e.g. `data/large-files/`.

This folder is set in `.gitignore` to be ignored when pushing/pulling. (The folder itself and the readme will be synced, but all other files will be ignored.)

This allows large files to be part of the project. If you want to collaborate with someone or work on multiple computers, you need to manually share/transfer everything in this folder, e.g. by Dropbox/OneDrive/etc.

If you use a cloud service, you should add the link to the storage location and instructions for obtaining access below.
