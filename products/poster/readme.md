This folder could contain a poster created using Quarto.

Unfortunately, there is currently no user-friendly and flexible way to create good-looking posters in Quarto. It is possible, but requires a lot of fiddling.

If you want to give it a try, the best starting point we are currently aware of is this Quarto/Typst template: https://github.com/quarto-ext/typst-templates/tree/main/poster
